We will use these tools to answer typical programming questions like: How can we be certain a solution exists? Am I sure my program computes the optimal answer? Do each of these objects meet the given requirements?\\n\\nIn the course, we use a try-this-before-we-explain-everything approach: you will be solving many interactive (and mobile friendly) puzzles that were carefully designed to allow you to invent many of the important ideas and concepts yourself.\\n\\nPrerequisites: \\n1. We assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), common sense and curiosity. \\n2. Basic programming knowledge is necessary as some quizzes require programming in Python.',\n",

Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. \\n\\nThe models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology.

You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. \\n\\nIn this course – together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni – we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\\n\\nLearning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?\\n\\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this is the course for you.\\n\\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and discovery. \\n\\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\\nWeek 1 - Leadership Acumen.

       " ['Welcome to this massive open online course (MOOC) about Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Please read the points below before you start the course. This will help you prepare well for the course and attend it properly. It will also help you determine if the course offers the knowledge and skills you are looking for.\\n\\nWhat can you do with QCA?\\n•\\tQCA is a comparative method that is mainly used in the social sciences for the assessment of cause-effect relations (i.e. causation). \\n•\\tQCA is relevant for researchers who normally work with qualitative methods and are looking for a more systematic way of comparing and assessing cases. \\n•\\tQCA is also useful for quantitative researchers who like to assess alternative (more complex) aspects of causation, such as how factors work together in producing an effect.\\n•\\tQCA can be used for the analysis of cases on all levels: macro (e.g. countries), meso (e.g. organizations) and micro (e.g. individuals).\\n•\\tQCA is mostly used for research of small- and medium-sized samples and populations (10-100 cases), but it can also be used for larger groups. Ideally, the number of cases is at least 10. QCA cannot be used if you are doing an in-depth study of one case.\\n\\nWhat will you learn in this course?\\n•\\tThe course is designed for people who have no or little experience with QCA.\\n•\\tAfter the course you will understand the methodological foundations of QCA. \\n•\\tAfter the course you will know how to conduct a basic QCA study by yourself. \\n\\nHow is this course organized?\\n•\\tThe MOOC takes five weeks. The specific learning objectives and activities per week are mentioned in appendix A of the course guide. Please find the course guide under Resources in the main menu. \\n•\\tThe learning objectives with regard to understanding the foundations of QCA and practically conducting a QCA study are pursued throughout the course. However, week 1 focuses more on the general analytic foundations, and weeks 2 to 5 are more about the practical aspects of a QCA study.\\n•\\tThe activities of the course include watching the videos, consulting supplementary material where necessary, and doing assignments. The activities should be done in that order: first watch the videos; then consult supplementary material (if desired) for more details and examples; then do the assignments.\\n•\\tThere are 10 assignments. Appendix A in the course guide states the estimated time needed to make the assignments and how the assignments are graded. Only assignments 1 to 6 and 8 are mandatory. These 7 mandatory assignments must be completed successfully to pass the course.\\n•\\tMaking the assignments successfully is one condition for receiving a course certificate. Further information about receiving a course certificate can be found here: https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819053-Get-a-Course-Certificate \\n\\nAbout the supplementary material\\n•\\tThe course can be followed by watching the videos. It is not absolutely necessary yet recommended to study the supplementary reading material (as mentioned in the course guide) for further details and examples. Further, because some of the covered topics are quite technical (particularly topics in weeks 3 and 4 of the course), we provide several worked examples that supplement the videos by offering more specific illustrations and explanation. These worked examples can be found under Resources in the main menu.\\n•\\tNote that the supplementary readings are mostly not freely available. Books have to be bought or might be available in a university library; journal publications have to be ordered online or are accessible via a university license.\\n•\\tThe textbook by Schneider and Wagemann (2012) functions as the primary reference for further information on the topics that are covered in the MOOC. Appendix A in the course guide mentions which chapters in that book can be consulted for which week of the course.\\n•\\tThe publication by Schneider and Wagemann (2012) is comprehensive and detailed, and covers almost all topics discussed in the MOOC. However, for further study, appendix A in the course guide also mentions some additional supplementary literature.\\n•\\tPlease find the full list of references for all citations (mentioned in this course guide, in the MOOC, and in the assignments) in appendix B of the course guide.',\n",

Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\\nGlobalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond 15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what? Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories, rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute to overcome the bias towards national comparison? \\nFor the time being, given current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing, differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities, buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts, senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare, education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities, everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....\\nClassic urban questions about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.\\n\\nAll video produced by Sciences Po for this Mooc are under Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\\n\\nRecommended Background\\nThe course is designed for undergraduates but it also will interest graduates and professionals concerned in urban issues.\\n\\nThe course is organized in 8 sequences and displays multimedia contents (images, video, original documents).

Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.\\n\\nThree features of the new system are central.\\n\\nMost important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  \\n\\nSecond, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. \\n\\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.\",\n",

It teaches how to diagnose social norms, and how to distinguish them from other social constructs, like customs or conventions. These distinctions are crucial for effective policy interventions aimed to create new, beneficial norms or eliminate harmful ones. The course teaches how to measure social norms and the expectations that support them, and how to decide whether they cause specific behaviors.  The course is a joint Penn-UNICEF project, and it includes many examples of norms that sustain behaviors like child marriage, gender violence and sanitation practices. \\n\\nThis is Part 1 of the Social Norms, Social Change series. In these lectures, I introduce all the basic concepts and definitions, such as social expectations and conditional preferences, that help us distinguish between different types of social practices like customs, descriptive norms and social norms. Expectations and preferences can be measured, and these lectures explain how to measure them. Measurement is crucial to understanding the nature of the practice you are facing, as well as whether an intervention was or was not successful, and why.

       " [\"This seven-week course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons to laws around the world, especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government.  And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks.\\n\\n The course will explore seven topics:\\n\\n 1.      Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet. We will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early 1975, the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum tube, moves to transistors, then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor. We will look at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition between selling software and open-source approaches as well as the problem of software piracy. We will discus the public good nature of software. The 1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal computer market and started the path to Microsoft's powerful position and eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn to four antitrust cases against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating to MS-DOS licensing practices; (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over Microsoft’s response to Netscape Navigator; (3) the European Union case regarding Windows Media Player; and (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer. These disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free-standing personal computer and the Internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition.\\n\\n 2.      Google Emerges (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about its algorithm can be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find that their sales plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search results to a later page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators have evaluated how Google has exercised its power. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union have undertaken substantial investigations of Google’s practices and we will look at both of those.\\n\\n 3.      Smartphones. The Internet started on the desktop but the Internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets. And we have seen an interesting shift in that market away from Nokia handsets and the Blackberry to Apple's iPhone and its iOS platform and to the Android platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum policy and the effort to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at the activities of standard setting organizations, including the IEEE and the creation of the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents. We will look at the FTC action against Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple's lawsuit against Samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally, we will take a brief look at the European Commission's investigation into the Android platform.\\n\\n 4.      Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality. Facebook has more than 1 billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly 7 billion and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion. A course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality. Nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network industries, but at the same, discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks. We will start our look at the Internet by looking at the great first communications network of the United States, the post office and will look in particular at the Post Office Act of 1845.   We will then move to modern times and will consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the Internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.\\n\\n 5.      The Day the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music with the rise of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its successors. We start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano. We turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the performing rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust issues associated with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform, digital audio tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p technologies such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to p2p technology by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution, we entered the world of Apple and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated with Apple's music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking at emerging subscription services like Spotify and the service that Apple is building based on its purchase of Beats.\\n\\n 6.      Video: Listening and Watching. Images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state. That starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum, but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually the definition of digital television. And with the emergence first of cable TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge. We will consider the legal engineering that led to the DVD platform, which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation. We will sort through the creation of the digital TV platform and will also look at the copyright underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television.\\n\\n 7.      The Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and for academics, books are sacred objects. But the printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering a new era, the era of the mediated book. This is more than just a change in technology. We will look at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues about control over content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself. We will also look at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright fair use litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And we will look at the Amazon Kindle platform.\",\n",

Taught by one of the world’s leading experts in the field, this course will educate students about the fundamentals of international criminal law and policy.  We will explore the contours of international crimes such as genocide, war crimes, terrorism, and piracy.  We will examine unique modes of international criminal liability and specialized defenses.  And we will delve into the challenges of obtaining custody of the accused and maintaining control of the courtroom.\\n\\n-- Course Syllabus --\\n\\nThis course comprises eight units (or \"modules\"). Each will include an assigned reading, typically an article or book chapter, as well as a simulation designed to bring the readings to life.\\n\\nI will also offer video lectures on each of the topics, accompanied by slides.  In addition, there will be online role-play exercises and debates, enabling the students to share their own insights. \\n\\nThe order of class sessions will be:\\n\\n(1)     History: From Nuremberg to The Hague\\n\\n(2)     International Crimes Part 1: War Crimes, Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, and Torture\\n\\n(3)     International Crimes Part 2: Terrorism and Piracy\\n\\n(4)     Special modes of liability: command responsibility, co-perpetration, and incitement\\n\\n(5)      Special defenses: insanity, obedience to orders, duress, and head of state immunity\\n\\n(6)      Gaining custody of the accused: extradition, luring, abduction, and targeted killing\\n\\n(7)      Pre-Trial Issues: plea bargaining, self-representation, and exclusion of torture evidence\\n\\n(8)      Maintaining control of the courtroom    \\n\\n-- Recommended Background --\\n\\nYou don’t have to be a lawyer and there are no prerequisites for this course. However, the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students. Therefore, for all participants, reading and writing comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable. \\n\\n-- Suggested Readings --\\n\\nStudents should read the assigned online materials for each unit in advance of the class session.  \\n\\nIn addition, students are invited to subscribe to “War Crimes Prosecution Watch,” a free bi-weekly e-newsletter that summarizes the latest developments in the field of international criminal law.\\n\\n-- Course Format --\\n\\nThis course is made up of eight content units. Each unit is based on an online reading assignment, a video lecture of about one hour in length, and one or more role play exercises to stimulate on-line discussion. The course also offers in-video enrichment quizzes (ungraded) for each unit, a ten question multiple choice midterm diagnostics exam (ungraded), and a ten question True/False Final Exam.   \\n\\n-- FAQ--\\n\\nHow will this course be graded? \\n\\nThis course is graded on completion.

Neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.\\n\\nThe course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more advanced courses and trainings in the future. For some topics, the course will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts in the field. Each module provides optional reading material.\\n\\nThe course structure is as follows: During each video, you will have to answer some relevant questions. Your answers will not affect your final grade. At the end of each module, you must complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions. To pass the course, you must reach a satisfactory standard in all the course modules by completing all graded quizzes and the final exam. In addition to watching video lectures and taking quizzes, you will receive an invitation to join our forum. We plan to join the discussions in the forum on a weekly basis.\\n\\nWelcome to Neuroeconomics World!',\n",

Este curso trata sobre cómo se decide qué problemas abordar y qué soluciones adoptar. Un proceso primordialmente político y social que suele escapar al análisis puramente racional.\\n\\nA lo largo del curso analizaremos por qué algunos problemas adquieren la categoría de problemas públicos mientras que otros no llegan a captar la atención, describiremos la pugna política que suele haber tras la descripción e interpretación de los problemas, identificaremos el complejo entramado de actores dispuestos a influir en la adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo las discrepancias se suelen extender más allá de la toma de decisiones y hasta la aplicación práctica de la política pública. Trataremos también sobre las grandes dificultades que padecen gobiernos y actores sociales para llegar a saber si las políticas que se llevan a cabo son realmente útiles y cómo aprender a mejorar su rendimiento.\\n\\n Los objetivos de este curso son:\\n1.\\tMostrar a los alumnos un número de casos reales que ilustran la complejidad de los procesos de adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo estos procesos pueden ser incoherentes con los modelos racionales de toma de decisiones.\\n2.\\tTransmitir a los alumnos los fundamentos e instrumental del análisis de políticas públicas para que puedan afrontar creativamente problemas del mundo real.\\n3.\\tContribuir a que los alumnos sean ciudadanos conocedores del funcionamiento de los sistemas democráticos.\\n\\n\\nPor ello, el curso se dirige a todas las personas interesadas en los problemas colectivos, así como a aquellas que quieran convertirse en participantes influyentes en el proceso de formación de las políticas, ya sea como analistas, funcionarios públicos, trabajadores del tercer sector, o como ciudadanos comprometidos en causas políticas.

This course familiarizes you with some main theories of international relations, shows how the global order is gradually changing and discusses how selected international and regional organizations contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. You learn what research findings tell us in terms of the capacity of international organizations and actors to help prevent or stop violent conflict, what tools are used to negotiate agreements and how foundations for sustainable peace are best created. We will also focus on the role of the European Union in terms of diplomacy and efforts to prevent conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the contribution of organizations such as the African Union to the prevention of conflict and war. We will study the United Nations Security Council and see in which ways its membership could be adapted to more accurately reflect the power relations of the current global order. Through quizzes and exercises testing your knowledge of these subjects, you will understand crucial concepts and get insights into how the academic study of international relations and international organization contributes to the search for global stability and peace in practice.',\n",

En proposant pour la première fois une initiation en langue française, il s’agit de faire connaître l’apport des études genre aux sciences sociales et plus généralement de faire œuvre citoyenne, en sensibilisant les participant.e.s et les étudiant.e.s aux inégalités sociales entre les hommes et les femmes et aux formes de discriminations directes ou indirectes qui les concernent dans leur diversité. Le cours utilise différentes théories et matériaux empiriques et s’inscrit dans une perspective interdisciplinaire en mobilisant l’histoire, la sociologie, l’anthropologie et les sciences politiques. Il valorise une lecture transversale et approfondie de phénomènes contemporains complexes, telle que la question des différences et des identités sexuelles, celle des inégalités à l’échelle locale et globale et celle de l’intersection des rapports de pouvoir. En mobilisant les travaux consacrés à ce qu’on appelle « l’intersectionalité », c’est-à-dire la combinaison des divers clivages sociaux et rapports de pouvoir, il met en effet l’accent sur les processus qui participent de la fabrication des différences (qu’elles soient liées au genre, à la classe, à la “race”, à la sexualité, à la religion) et analyse leurs interconnexions. A l'aide d’exemples variés tirés de recherches disponibles en français et en anglais, de media, d’enquêtes ou d’archives, il cherche à comprendre et expliquer dans leurs contextes spécifiques, les multiples ressorts des logiques de genre qui structurent les sociétés contemporaines.\",\n",

We recommend you sign up for a certificate as this course is on premium grading and you will only enjoy the full benefit of the project if you can join in with the assignments. In addition this course contains the exciting opportunity to research and analyze historical decisionmaking, international relations, business cases and battles  in an effort to truly understand constructing a convincing argument.\\n\\nMost important decisions in life, and many unimportant ones, are taken after some degree of reflection. If those decisions affect other people, we may take some advice and we might even follow it. The larger the issue and the greater number of people involved, the more likely that advice process will be institutionalised. Most of us tend to think of policy advice in the context of things as counsel to politicians in matters of national security or policy-making by governments. Of course, we also know that it takes place on a regular basis within businesses and other organisations. But it also happens in local politics and in local campaigns and in everyday life. Every time you try to influence someone’s decision, you are offering policy advice. Even if you are not planning to be an active advisor, the discipline of collecting and arranging the necessary materials is useful in all kinds of research and writing exercises. Writing a policy advice is what we call a ‘transferrable skill’.\\n\\nThe course requires an academic approach, but no previous experience. The projects can be completed by both novices and advanced learners. One thing is certain. Both groups will learn a lot from the experience. \\n\\nWhat is a policy advice?\\nIn its simplest form, a policy advice is a short paper that argues your position on a particular issue and the course of action you propose. It also tries to convince the audience to adopt your position and to take action on your advice. \\n\\nWhat advice can I give?\\nYou may well have a topic already, based on your work or your social situation. This could be a piece of equipment your firm might want to buy or a new market it might wish to enter. It could be a campaign for a local play area or against pollution in local ground-water. In this case it is a question of arranging and presenting your position, and discussing it with others in a similar position.\\n\\n On the other hand, you might be open for suggestions. In this case, we have prepared some topics covering business case studies, issues of current affairs, and historical examples. For example, you could look into the archives advise Harry Truman to adopt a different policy towards the Soviet Union at the start of the Cold War. Alternatively you could suggest advise the Incas in 1532 not to be so trusting in their dealings with the Spanish. After all, you will know the outcome. So the course should appeal to everyone interested in practical policy-making as well as amateur historians, strategy gamers. Everyone can have fun applying these techniques to their favourite topics.\\n\\nWhat will I learn?\\nThe project-based course is designed so that you learn by doing rather than by listening. The assignments that you complete, the feedback that you receive and the assignments of others that you read and upon which you comment are all intrinsic parts of the course. The lectures are designed to act as signposts along the way and the readings allow you to explore some of the issues in greater depth. During the whole course experience you will learn to:\\n•\\tFrame a starting position for your own research\\n•\\tUse search engines to locate materials required for your advice\\n•\\tExplore ‘academic’ data-bases\\n•\\tAnnotate your sources correctly\\n•\\tTarget your research for statistical data\\n•\\tChoose a visualisation for your statistical data \\n•\\tConstruct an argument in a logical manner\\n•\\tBuild up the logic in each paragraph \\n•\\tConduct a SWOT analysis\\n•\\tConduct a Risk Analysis\\n•\\tPresent the materials in a position paper\\n•\\tConvert the position paper to a policy advice\\n•\\tRecognise the policy-making hierarchy and shaping the advice accordingly \\n•\\tWrite a powerful and effective PowerPoint presentation\\n•\\tPlace your project in the ‘real world’ context of the policy-cycle\\n•\\tAnd ... Discover a great, great deal about your chosen topic.\\n\\nHow much time will the course take?\\nThe lecture materials in each module will themselves take no more than 30 minutes to view and review. Each module is accompanied by selected reading materials, but these are not compulsory. There is also a Skills Lab with extra literature and videos to assist you to improve your writing, computer and presentation skills. Combining these parts of the course, and assuming that you make some use of all the facilities offered, the ‘on-platform’ time should take no more than an one hour for each module. \\nThe project-time depends on the degree of advancement in the project choice. If you come with a ready prepared idea and knowledge of the area, then the project-time should in total be approximately four to five hours. If you decide to use the suggestions in our collections, then you should add another three to four hours to familiarise yourself with the subject and the necessary materials. If you should decide to start a completely new project from scratch, the you would need to add another three hours or so to orient yourself in the problem and then locating the required materials.\\n\\nAbout Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way.

The introduction of Smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures has resulted in numerous challenges and opportunities for contemporary cities and will continue to do so. This course will help you to understand how to make the best of these smart technologies in your cities’ legacy infrastructures.  \\nOver the past few years, advances in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable land scape of urban infrastructure service provision. This has resulted in increasing interest from both technology vendors and public authorities in the transition of cities towards so-called “Smart Cities”. Although such “Smart technologies” can provide immense opportunities for citizens and service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision.\\nIn this MOOC, you will gain a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the Smart urban infrastructures, namely Smart urban transportation and Smart urban energy systems.

However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.\\n\\nBut what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?\\n\\nThis course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century learning:\\n\\n1.

Local economic development refers to the processes by which local governments, businesses, and civil society groups get together to raise income sustainably and improve their lives in a well-defined area. It’s about creating jobs, securing livelihoods, improving infrastructure and managing local resources.\\n\\nWhat do I learn?\\n\\nWe will be dealing with questions such as the following. Why does economic development take place in some areas of the world and not in others? Why doesn’t it happen in your place? What prevents people from having the lives they want to live right there? Could your region make more of the opportunities of globalization and new technologies? Did the promises of decentralization in your country fail to deliver better public services and more responsive governments? If these are the questions you are asking yourself, this is the right course for you. It explores the where, who and how of economic development.\\n\\nPlease have a look at our list of contents for the coming 8 weeks:\\n1.\\tWhat is LED? What drives it?\\n2.\\tHow does globalization shape LED?\\n3.\\tHow does decentralisation affect LED?\\n4.\\tHow does competitiveness affect innovation?\\n5.\\tWhat are entrepreneurship and its dimensions?\\n6.\\tWhy are value chains and clusters so important?\\n7.\\tWhat are some LED strategies?\\n8.\\tYour project\\n\\nHow will I learn?\\n\\nIn each week you will be able to access the content of the videos, suggested readings and additional videos for selective deepening. You will also find assignments that you have to complete if you want to earn a certificate for this MOOC. We will first introduce our “toolkit”, a series of theories and concepts that will help you read the situation in your locality. We will explore the main factors affecting local economic development, such as globalization, decentralisation, and competitiveness. We will discuss key components, like entrepreneurship and innovation and look into the organization of local economies into clusters, value chains and learning regions. We will conclude by deepening on some specific constructs that make local economies grow to benefit their communities. You will also contribute your ideas in the discussion forums, where you will learn from other participants around the world. \\n\\nWhat makes this course special? \\nThere is plenty of information in Internet on local economic development, which is mostly prepared by international donors or multilateral organisations. So what does this course do differently? First of all, the course is offered by academics that have significant published research on local economic development. This course gathers a wealth of academic knowledge that often fights the assumptions on what things are supposed to be like. Second, the instructors of this course have participated in dozens of capacity building projects in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Putting learning at the centre, they worked with communities, local governments, international donors and business associations. They often found a significant distance between theory and practice in local economic development, and this has been the basis of learning. Third, the course is acutely aware that each region is different and does not attempt to offer a one-size-fits-all recipe. It singles out key factors that drive local economic development and enables participants to do their own learning process, defining local problems and appropriate solutions. The aim of the course is that participants come up with their own ideas on how to promote local economic development.\\n\\nHow will I get a certificate?\\n\\nIf you want a certificate for participating in this MOOC, you will need to complete a small assignment each week and participate in the discussion forums. In the end of the MOOC, you will put these contributions together in one final document, your Capstone Project. \\n\\nI hope you find this course exciting and that you get to share our passion for promoting local economic development. \\n\\nYour instructors\\nDr. Georgina M.

The first course covered international courts and tribunals in The Hague in general. This second course provides an insider perspective into the work of international criminal courts and tribunals.  You will learn about the investigation and prosecution of international crimes in The Hague. \\n\\nAtrocities produce unspeakable forms of violence. We will explore whether and how international criminal justice contribute to what UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon called the ‘age of accountability’. The theory is, those who commit the worst of human crimes, are held accountable, whether they are rank-and-file foot soldiers or military commanders, whether they are lowly civil servants following orders or top political leaders. We will test  how this can be done and if this is realistic.\\n\\nDuring this course, you will be offered a look into the ‘kitchen’ of the Hague international criminal courts and tribunals. You will learn how international criminal justice functions, who the actors are, what outcomes it produces, and how it can be improved. \\n\\nIf you want to gain a better understanding of international criminal cases, like the Lubanga case, the ICC’s first ever trial, and the legal legacy of UN international criminal tribunals, then this course is definitely for you!\\n\\nThis course is free to join and to participate in. There is the possibility to get a verified certificate for the course, which is a paid option. If you want a certificate, but are unable to pay for it, you can request financial aid via Coursera.',\n",

We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our decisions, markets signal where to put effort, they direct firms to produce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us. \\n\\nThis course is an introduction to the microeconomic theory of markets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We will start with the concept of scarcity and how specialization according to comparative advantage helps us achieve more than we could alone. Next we model a marked using the tools of Supply and Demand and learn what well working markets accomplish and what their limit are. We end by exploring the impact of government intervention on perfect markets. Examples are taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all purchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and policy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be an educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and evaluate market outcomes.',\n",

In this course we will explore the different models of blended learning and dive into key issues that impact students, teachers, and schools. Specifically, we will look at these issues through the lens of three high-performing schools that each use a different type of blended learning.  A few of the key topics will include:\\n\\n- The role of the student and how to support students in the transition from traditional to blended learning\\n- Implications for teachers in their day-to-day work and overall role\\n- Impact on the way schools are designed including staffing models, use of time, hardware/software selection, and the use of data\\n- Implementation challenges, potential solutions, and the remaining open questions\\n\\nWe will live by the attributes of blended learning in this course, encouraging students to take quizzes at the beginning of the module to assess their understanding and skip material they already know. Overall, we will take a hand-on approach and the course will culminate in participants prototyping their own blended learning model.\\n\\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to best leverage technology in education and rethink the way we run schools, join this MOOC and encourage your colleagues to do the same.

Equip yourself and learn more about what human rights are and how they work. \\n\\nIn this course, we will introduce you to one of the world’s most intricate human rights systems: the European Convention on Human Rights. You will see when and how people can turn to the European Court of Human Rights to complain about human rights violations. You will learn how the Court tries to solve many of the difficult human rights dilemmas of today. We will look, amongst other things, at the freedom of expression and demonstration, the right to vote, and the prohibition of discrimination. And we will address the rights of migrants, refugees, and other vulnerable groups. And, of course, we will see whether it is possible to restrict rights and if so under what conditions. You will even encounter watchdogs and ice cream in this course. We invite you to follow us on a journey of discovery into the European Convention!',\n",

Why do some social innovations take off with relative ease, while others struggle for years without spreading?  More generally, what are the forces that control the process of social evolution –from the fashions that we wear, to our beliefs about religious tolerance, to our ideas about the process of scientific discovery and the best ways to manage complex research organizations? \\n\\nThe social world is complex and full of surprises. Our experiences and intuitions about the social world as individuals are often quite different from the behaviors that we observe emerging in large societies. Even minor changes to the structure of a social network - changes that are unobservable to individuals within those networks - can lead to radical shifts in the spread of new ideas and behaviors through a population. These “invisible” mathematical properties of social networks have powerful implications for the ways that teams solve problems, the social norms that are likely to emerge, and even the very future of our society.  \\n\\nThis course condenses the last decade of cutting-edge research on these topics into six modules.  Each module provides an in-depth look at a particular research puzzle -with a focus on agent-based models and network theories of social change -and provides an interactive computational model for you try out and to use for making your own explorations!  \\n\\n\\nLearning objectives - after this course, students will be able to...\\n- explain how computer models are used to study challenging social problems \\n- describe how networks are used to represent the structure of social relationships \\n- show how individual actions can lead to unintended collective behaviors\\n- provide concrete examples of how social networks can influence social change \\n- discuss how diffusion processes can explain the growth social movements, changes in cultural norms, and the success of team problem solving',\n",

Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently.\\nThis course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th and 21st centuries.\\n\\nThree common themes will characterise the course:\\xa0\\n\\nWe privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional.\\xa0\\n\\nWe seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood.\\xa0\\n\\nWe seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity.\\xa0\\n\\nUltimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.',\n",

Over four weeks of lectures, this advanced course considers how to design interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making and voting systems), mechanism design, and auctions.\\n\\nIn the first week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents\\' preferences, discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow\\'s Theorem, which proves that there is no \"perfect\" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain \"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an introduction to auction theory.\\n\\nYou can find a full syllabus and description of the course here:  http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/GTOC-II-Syllabus.html \\n\\nThere is also a predecessor course to this one, for those who want to learn or remind themselves of the basic concepts of game theory: https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1  \\n\\nAn intro video can be found here:   http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/Game-Theory-2-Intro.mp4',\n",

What measures do educators, schools, communities need to take in order to make the multilingual and multicultural learning space more effective? The course Introduction to Multilingual and Multicultural Learning makes an attempt to provide answers to these and other related questions with reference to the latest research and discussion of different case studies.\\n\\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\\n- critically evaluate various teaching practices in multilingual and multicultural settings;\\n- critically evaluate various language policies and planning programmes implemented in multilingual education settings;\\n- obtain valuable insights to better understand the learning needs of students in a multilingual/multicultural classroom;\\n- apply the knowledge you will have gained in this course, in multilingual/multicultural classrooms;\\n- obtain essential skills to deal with immigrant/minority language students.',\n",

We may often use social media without thinking much about the possible consequences.   But there is a shadow side associated with social media use, which takes the form of hate speech, increased surveillance, lack of anonymity and questionable use of our data. What do we need to know to use social media spaces effectively, in a way that is safe and productive for all?\\n\\nThis course will guide you into a deeper exploration of online identity, social media communities and their users.  You will examine the ways that social media is being used by public institutions such as government to build participation and conversation with audiences.  You will encounter the most common ethical debates in social media.  \\n\\nYou will also have the opportunity to build your practical skills by developing your professional social media profile, defining your audience, building your social media influence and understanding how to interpret data analytics to \"listen\" and communicate well.',\n",

Les partenariats public-privés (PPP) sont un des outils que les gouvernements peuvent utiliser pour contribuer à la mise en place de meilleurs services publics. Ce cours vous permettra de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils peuvent jouer dans la réduction du déficit d’infrastructures. Le cours présentera les difficultés et les défis rencontrés lors de la sélection des projets jusqu’à leur mise en œuvre. Ainsi, vous améliorerez votre compréhension sur l’opportunité ou non de recourir à un PPP pour développer un projet d’infrastructure.\\n\\nDurant ce cours de quatre semaines, vous bénéficierez de l’expertise de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience transactionnelle pour approfondir vos connaissances.\\nPlusieurs ressources seront proposées chaque semaine, tels des films vidéos d’experts et de praticiens, des lectures obligatoires et facultatives, un questionnaire à choix multiples portant sur le thème de la semaine, et des exercices pour parfaire vos compétences d’analyse, de réflexion et de communication.\\n\\n~~ Semaine 1: Réduire le déficit d’infrastructure : le rôle des PPP\\n\\nCe premier module explique comment et pourquoi l’expertise et les ressources du secteur privé peuvent être mobilisées par les gouvernements pour contribuer à la réduction de leur déficit d’infrastructures. Ce module introduit le concept de PPP, ses caractéristiques, et les types de modalités contractuelles reflétant le degré de participation du secteur privé. Les PPP ne regroupent pas tous les contrats entre une personne publique et une personne privée, et ce module définit également ce que n’est pas un PPP. Des exemples d’échecs ou de PPP réussis seront utilisés pour illustrer les conditions optimales pour réussir des projets, et pour souligner la nécessité d’une analyse précise, ainsi que l’importance de la durabilité, la participation des acteurs et la bonne gouvernance des PPP.\\n\\n~~ Semaine 2: Prendre les bonnes décisions: les cadres législatifs et institutionnels dédiés aux PPP\\n\\nCe module examine les principes, valeurs et défis que requièrent la mise en place d’un cadre facilitant l’exécution des projets de PPP dans l’optique d’améliorer les services publics et l’investissement en infrastructure. Vous bénéficierez des leçons apprises lors de la réalisation des PPP et de leur incorporation dans des cadres législatifs efficaces. La semaine 2 vous apportera également une vue d’ensemble des différentes étapes du cycle de vie des PPP et approfondira la première phase : l’identification et la sélection des projets.\\n\\n~~ Semaine 3: Susciter l’engagement du partenaire approprié: la passation des PPP\\n\\nCe module débute par une discussion sur la nécessité de développer des arguments commerciaux solides pour transformer un projet en PPP, et insiste sur l’importance de la structure du partenariat pour garantir une répartition des risques appropriée entre les commanditaires privés, les bailleurs de fonds, et le gouvernement. Ce module passe en revue les différentes étapes du processus d’appel d’offres et explique les défis rencontrés pour parvenir à un bon résultat, et explique le rôle des bailleurs qui sont souvent des acteurs clés dans la structuration de l’appel d’offre.\\n\\n~~ Semaine 4: Obtenir un partenariat réussi: la mise en œuvre du PPP \\n\\nCe module présente les aspects fondamentaux et les difficultés dans la gestion des contrats, tels que l’application de l’exécution du contrat, et sa renégociation ou sa résiliation. Enfin, ce module couvre la gestion des offres non sollicitées qui, bien qu’en dehors d’un processus de mise en concurrence, peuvent être une source d’idées innovantes.\\n\\n~~ Comment bénéficier au maximum de ce cours? Interagir et approfondir\\n\\nLes participants peuvent choisir l’un des deux parcours « Compréhension des PPP » ou « Politique et Pratique des PPP » en fonction de leur intérêt et objectifs professionnels. Le parcours « Compréhension des PPP » vise les personnes ayant un intérêt général pour les PPP et désirant améliorer leur compréhension du sujet. Le parcours permet aux auditeurs de se familiariser avec les concepts de base des PPP et leurs principaux outils, et offre la possibilité de communiquer avec des professionnels et des praticiens.

This course explores the support that teachers need in order to meet the needs of children with severe to profound hearing, visual or intellectual disabilities. The UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 commits the global community to achieving inclusive and equitable quality education for all. To ensure equity in education, children with disabilities need reasonable accommodation to be able to learn. In this five week course, we consider how this can be done, by talking with a range of experts (from teachers to activists) about inclusive education and about their experiences of education. \\n\\nInclusive education is only possible if teachers are supported and empowered to make the curriculum accessible to all learners. The topics in this course cover developing disability confidence and what exactly children with specific impairments need to be able to learn. This includes sharing specific classroom strategies and teaching activities for learners who are D/deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision or have a severe to profound intellectual disability. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with the impairment specific needs of learners with disabilities, and how to build systems of support for inclusive education.\\n\\nYou will be able to purchase a Verified Certificate if you wish to show evidence of your achievements, but this is optional, and you may apply for Financial Aid if you are unable to pay the certificate fee.\\n\\nThis course was developed as part of the project ´Strengthening teaching for Children with profound Hearing, Visual & Intellectual Disabilities in South Africa` co-funded by Christoffel-Blinden Mission (CBM) and the European Union.',\n",

Here we invite you to develop analytical skills and deep understanding about a complex, controversial policy problem – one with no simple, easy answers. About half a billion people on our planet still lack access to improved water supplies and about two billion do not have improved sanitation services, leading to an unknown but very large number of avoidable deaths each year from water-related diseases. Millions of dollars are spent on avoidable health care expenditures, and people – mostly women – spend many billions of hours carrying water from sources outside the home. Reducing these costs is a major global challenge for us all in the 21st century. Join us to explore the challenging and complex political, economic, social, and technical dimensions of the policy interventions that donors, national governments and water utilities use to address this challenge. This second MOOC consists of the following seven sessions:\\n\\n•\\tSession 1: Introduction and how our ‘ancient instincts’ affect water policy interventions.\\n•\\tSession 2: Planning better policy interventions: Roles, features and examples of planning protocols.\\n•\\tSession 3: Water pricing, tariff design and subsidies.\\n•\\tSession 4: Providing information to households and communities to improve water and sanitation conditions.\\n•\\tSession 5: Changing the institutions that deliver water and sanitation services: Privatization in developing countries.\\n•\\tSession 6: Changing institutions: Lessons from the UK water privatization story.\\n•\\tSession 7: Changing institutions: Improving regulation of the water and sanitation sector.\\n\\nYour instructors for this course have worked in and studied this sector for many years. Professor Dale Whittington has worked on water and sanitation policy and planning issues for over 40 years in more than two dozen low and middle-income countries. Dr Duncan Thomas has worked in the UK and European water sectors for 15 years, focusing on overcoming barriers to technological, organizational, regulatory and policy innovations. \\n\\nPlease watch this introductory video outlining the course: https://youtu.be/KkBmo3EKkkI',\n",

The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.\\n\\nToday, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?\\n\\nThis course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead “has given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.” This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special.

Every day, we see high-level government officials resigning, governments changing, hundreds of thousands of people standing in squares, holding up signs, and often risking their lives to protest the corruption in the world. It's critically important to the health of our societies to understand what people are protesting against. We want to understand corruption. This course is designed to teach you about what corruption is, what causes corruption, the effects of corruption, and how to control corruption. We'll be talking about this from a global perspective using examples from all over the world. We'll also be talking about corruption from the perspective of countries, governments, businesses, citizens, and the people within these entities. At the end of this course, you'll have a better understanding of why the world is changing according to the path of corruption.

Российская перспектива.»  удостоился премии Правительства Санкт-Петербурга за выдающиеся достижения в области высшего образования и среднего профессионального образования 2018 года в номинации «Развитие инновационной деятельности в образовательной организации».\\n\\n«Правовое регулирование отношений в Интернете» – обзорный курс, нацеленный на формирование основных представлений о подходах к регулированию глобальной информационно-телекоммуникационной сети. Основная задача курса заключается в формировании целостного представления об отношениях в Интернете как о предмете правового регулирования. Курс построен на системном методологическом подходе, предполагающем, в первую очередь, анализ «сквозных» правовых проблем, обусловленных архитектурой глобальной сети и ее гибкостью (например, проблем идентификации пользователей, определения юрисдикции и  ответственности информационных посредников), который развивался в российской литературе В.Б. Наумовым, В.В. Архиповым, А.И. Савельевым и др. Главная особенность курса выражается в сочетании классических юридических методов и контекста инновационных технологических областей. Помимо проблем собственно Интернета в курсе содержится, в том числе, обзор проблематики криптовалют на примере Биткоин и технологии блокчейн, правовых аспектов виртуальных миров и многопользовательских компьютерных игр, а также самой противоречивой из актуальных «горячих» тем на точке пересечения права и технологии – роботов (именно авторы курса являются соавторами дискуссионного законопроекта о робототехнике, призванного послужить началом обсуждения проблематики правосубъектности роботов). Помимо теории и обзора регулятивных подходов, курс содержит анализ отдельной актуальной российской судебной практики, изменившей представления о подходах к регулированию Интернета, в том числе дело о блокировке социальной сети LinkedIn (истец – Роскомнадзор) в 2016 году, подтвердившее системное изменение подходов к интернет-юрисдикции, и дело Mail.Ru Games (истец – Федеральная налоговая служба), определившее реальные правовые подходы к виртуальной собственности. Экспертиза авторов курса во многом обусловлена тем, что они, среди отдельных своих коллег-энтузиастов, стояли у истоков юридической практики (В.Б. Наумов) и научно-преподавательской деятельности (В.Б. Наумов, В.В. Архипов) в данной области, и ими накоплен уникальный опыт в IT / IP практике международной юридической фирмы Dentons, а также в ходе общественно-консультативной деятельности, в том числе в рамках Консультативного совета Роскомнадзора, экспертных групп программы «Цифровая экономика Российской Федерации».

Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and man-made. For most of history the man-made variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their \"surpassing disproportion\". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation\\'s transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States\\' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation\\'s critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation\\'s infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don\\'t see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.

The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as \"lifeline infrastructure\". The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water, 2) energy, 3) transportation, and 4) communications. These sectors are designated \"lifeline\" because many other infrastructures depend upon them.  The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector, and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector.  Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans.  The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on.  The Department of Energy, though, recommended voluntary application of the ES-C2M2.

Ya sea como madres, padres, cuidadores, profesores, profesionales de la salud, interesados en los medios de comunicación o en el tema de la sexualidad, con frecuencia nos planteamos preguntas como las siguientes: ¿Para qué educar sobre sexualidad, si existe abundante información al respecto? ¿La educación de la sexualidad debería brindarla la familia o la escuela? ¿A qué edad es adecuado iniciar la educación de la sexualidad? ¿La educación de la sexualidad aumenta la curiosidad sobre este tema? Para responder estos y otros interrogantes planteados por quienes participan en nuestras iniciativas de investigación y en los diferentes procesos educativos que llevamos a cabo, hemos diseñado este segundo curso con respecto a la educación de la sexualidad en diferentes ámbitos. De esta manera también queremos responder a las solicitudes de quienes ya tomaron nuestro primer Curso “Sexualidad… mucho más que sexo” de facilitar el acceso a otros cursos que profundicen en este tema. \\n \\nSi decides realizar este curso, esperamos que al final puedas reconocer claramente qué significa educar en el campo de la sexualidad así como identificar en qué contextos y en qué momentos ocurre esta labor. Igualmente, aspiramos que al terminar este curso, te sientas con mayor seguridad de tu capacidad para garantizar este derecho a otras personas en cualquier contexto en el que vivas o trabajes.\\n\\nEn el grupo de Investigación Familia y Sexualidad de la Universidad de los Andes en Colombia tenemos un sueño: Que a todas las personas, sin distinción de ningún tipo,  se nos garantice el derecho a contar con información oportuna, útil, confiable y basada en evidencia sobre los diferentes aspectos que nos interesan de la sexualidad. Esperamos que decidas unirte a este desafío, si compartimos el mismo ideal podemos construir una red en la que gracias a tu complicidad y la de otras personas que toman nuestros cursos podemos lograr la transformación social que se requiere para que muy pronto el ejercicio del derecho a la educación de la sexualidad sea una realidad en tú país, en el nuestro y, por qué no, a nivel global.\\n\\nOrganizaciones aliadas:\\n\\nLa producción de este curso ha contado con el apoyo del Fondo de Población de las Naciones Unidas - UNFPA',\n",

And yet on the International Space Station, Garan, a former fighter pilot, was working work side by side with Russians, who only a few years before were “the enemy.” If fifteen nations could collaborate on one of the most ambitious, technologically complicated undertakings in history, surely we can apply that kind of cooperation and innovation toward creating a better world. \\n\\nIn this course Garan will convey what it was like learning to work with a diverse group of people in an environment only a handful of human beings have ever known.

Rather, our ambition is to give a bird\\'s-eye view of central themes of public economics and related disciplines, and teach concepts, logic, and ideas, rather than methods of analysis, which would require an entirely different course format.\\n\\nOur choice of topics covered by the course reflects a trade-off between salience and centrality, on the one hand, and suitability for a brief online introductory course, on the other. The course content is neither comprehensive (which would be a \"mission impossible\" for virtually any public economics course\"), nor representative of other such courses. With these limitations and caveats in mind, we encourage our students to continue their public economics studies in a more regular fashion, and see our role inter alia in motivating interest in such \"continued education\".\\n\\nThe central theme of the course is the role of government as a mechanism of resource allocation which complements and augments markets. Governments are viewed as public agencies set to correct market failures. Such agencies however are prone to failures of their own, and hence markets and governments are two imperfect alternatives. We deal with government\\'s limitations, with particular emphasis on those that have to do with informational asymmetry, limited administrative capacity, and imperfect accountability to society.

The second deals with the central institution of social welfare—the labor market, which largely determines how many resources a person has.  The labor market also establishes hierarchy, both through meritocracy and through categories of privilege.  The third is poverty: the differing ways we define who is poor, and how effective U.S. anti-poverty efforts have been.

Traditionally, the goals and outcomes of research projects were to contribute knowledge and communicate this knowledge through academic publications and journal articles. But If we truly want our research to have an impact, we need to do research differently. Research that influences change in policy, practice, behaviour and attitudes. \\n\\nOn this six-week journey, Jesse DeMaria-Kinney and Mark New share their experience of the Adaptation at Scale for Semi-arid Regions (ASSAR) Project, where they developed and refined the Research for Impact approach. They are joined by researchers and practitioners who followed this approach in their research. Together you will explore the five elements of the Research for Impact approach, i.e. Theory of Change; Stakeholder Engagement and Strategic Partnerships, Strategic Communication, Capacity Development; and Influencing. You will also get opportunities to hear from researchers and practitioners on the ground who followed this approach, and hopefully become inspired and equipped to incorporate these principles into your own research projects. \\n\\nThe course is free to enroll and take.

Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining and learning analytics systems in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by ‘big data’ including data persistency and student profiling.',\n",

En el mundo contemporáneo, el proceso de urbanización está alcanzando un nuevo pico con el incremento de las megalópolis (más de 15 millones de habitantes) como Calcuta, Los Ángeles, Daca, El Cairo, Tokio, Nueva York, Shanghái, Ciudad de México. o Seúl. Más allá de las metrópolis modernas, los investigadores intentan entender estas grandes zonas urbanas con el uso de distintos conceptos, tales como \"posmetrópolis\", \"ciudades globales\" y \"ciudades-regiones globales\". La clase estudiará debates y modelos de ciencias sociales de ciudades y metrópolis, para así analizar y comparar los desarrollos actuales. ¿Cómo podemos estudiar dichas ciudades cuando se convierten en megalópolis? ¿El tamaño importa, y para qué? ¿Acaso vemos la creación de un mundo urbano extenso o, en cambio, vemos más allá de la convergencia aparente de procesos complejos  de globalización comprendidos en relación con el capitalismo globalizado? ¿Es posible identificar las diferencias escondidas y el fortalecimiento de diversos mundos urbanos? ¿Cómo podemos lograr entender este mundo urbano cuando las ciudades no son unidades independientes, sino que tienen que compenetrarse en términos de territorio, instalación, y asimismo en materia de relaciones como el flujo, la movilidad y la circulación? ¿Cuál es la relevancia de los conceptos de las ciencias sociales desarrollados en el mundo occidental para poder analizar la transformación de Lagos? ¿Hasta qué punto puede el desarrollo sistemático de nuevas formas de comparación entre ciudades del norte y del sur cambiar las ciencias sociales y contribuir a superar el sesgo hacia la comparación nacional? \\nPor el momento, y considerando las condiciones actuales del capitalismo, los asuntos políticos, económicos, culturales y sociales se convierten cada vez más en asuntos urbanos. En la concepción moderna del mundo, caracterizada por el tamaño, la construcción de viviendas, la división del trabajo diferenciada y la densidad de interacción, existen diferentes concepciones de ciudades que se han entremezclado y, a veces, hasta se han enfrentado.  Dichas concepciones resaltan diferentes procesos de integración: el aspecto material de la ciudad, muros, plazas, viviendas, calles, iluminación, servicios públicos, edificios, desechos e infraestructura física; el aspecto cultural de la ciudad en términos de imaginación, diferencias, representaciones, ideas, símbolos, arte, textos, sentidos, religión y estética; los principios políticos y las políticas en materia de control, poder, gobierno, movilización, políticas públicas, bienes, educación; el aspecto social de la ciudad considerando los disturbios, las desigualdades étnicas, económicas y de género, la vida cotidiana y los movimientos sociales; y el aspecto económico de la ciudad: división del trabajo, escalas, producción, consumo, comercio, entre otros.\\nLos asuntos urbanos clásicos sobre las desigualdades, viviendas, gobierno e integración, se relacionan con cuestiones referentes al tejido urbano, asuntos de movilidad e instalación, desarrollo sostenible y riesgos, creación de ciudades ciborg, problemas de control social y disturbios, cultura urbana, innovación y desarrollo económico urbano.  \\n\\nTodos los vídeos realizados por Sciences Po para este MOOC están a cargo de Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\\n\\n\\nPerfil recomendado\\n\\nEl curso está diseñado para estudiantes de pregrado, pero también puede ser de interés para estudiantes de posgrado y profesionales en el sector de asuntos urbanos.\\n\\n\\nPrograma del curso :\\n\\nSemana 1: Introducción, definición, asuntos urbanos y el uso de modelos\\nSemana 2: Ciudades europeas y el modelo weberiano de integración\\nSemana 3: Ciudades coloniales y poscoloniales\\nSemana 4: Ciudades industriales (y ciudades socialistas) y modelos marxistas\\nSemana 5: Las metrópolis norteamericanas y la Escuela de Chicago \\nSemana 6: Posmetrópolis, fragmentos y diferencias\\nSemana 7: Ciudades globales y megaciudades\\nSemana 8: Ciudades inteligentes y la sociología de la ciencia y la tecnología',\n",

       " [\"La mondialisation et l'européanisation favorisent le développement rapide des villes à travers le monde. L'urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd’hui avec l'essor des mégacités (plus de 15 millions d'habitants) comme Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou Séoul. Au-delà de la métropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens à ces grandes régions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que « post-métropoles », « villes globales », et « régions métropolitaines globales ». Ce cours passera en revue les débats et les modèles de villes et métropoles actuels proposés par les sciences sociales afin d'en analyser et comparer les développements contemporains. Comment étudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des mégarégions urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on à la naissance d'un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-delà de l'apparente convergence de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d'identifier des différenciations masquées et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner à ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unités indépendantes mais doivent être comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d'enracinement mais également de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilité, les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences sociales développés en Occident pour l'analyse de la transformation de Lagos ? Jusqu'à quel point le développement systématique de nouvelles formes de comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire évoluer les sciences sociales et contribuer à surmonter la tendance à privilégier les comparaisons entre nations ? \\nPour l'instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme, les questions politiques, économiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale, caractérisée par la taille, par l'agrégation des logements, les divisions différenciées du travail, et la densité des interactions, plusieurs conceptions de la ville ont fini par s'entremêler et parfois s'opposer. Ces conceptions soulignent différents processus d'intégration : la ville matérielle et ses murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses bâtiments, ses déchets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires, des différences, des représentations, des idées, des symboles, des arts, des textes, des sens, des religions, et des esthétiques ; la politique et les politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement, de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de sécurité sociale, d'éducation ; la ville sociale des révoltes, des inégalités ethniques, économiques et de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l’économie de la ville : la division du travail, l'échelle, la production, la consommation, le commerce.....\\nLes questions urbaines classiques portant sur les inégalités, le logement, le gouvernement, l'intégration, se mêlent aux questions sur le tissu urbain, sur la mobilité et l'enracinement, sur le développement durable et les risques, sur l'apparition des villes « cyborg », sur le contrôle social et les émeutes, la culture urbaine, l'innovation, et le développement économique urbain.\\nToutes les vidéos produites par Sciences Po pour ce MOOC sont sous licence Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\\n\\nPlan du cours\\n\\nSemaine #1 : Introduction, définitions, questions urbaines et l'utilisation de modèles\\nSemaine #2 : Les villes européennes et le modèle d'intégration wébérien\\nSemaine #3 : Les villes coloniales et post coloniales\\nSemaine #4 : Les villes industrielles (et les villes socialistes) et les modèles marxistes\\nSemaine #5 : Les métropoles américaines et l'école de Chicago, \\nSemaine #6 : Les post-métropoles, fragments et différences\\nSemaine #7 : Les villes mondiales et les mégacités\\nSemaine #8 : Les villes intelligentes et la sociologie des sciences et technologies\",\n",

Are you interested in the issues revolving around EU employment law in the international road transport sector? Then, on behalf of the University of Antwerp, Erasmus University Rotterdam, University of Gdańsk, University of Luxembourg and Tilburg University, we would like to welcome you to this MOOC on Cross-border Road Transport in EU law context. This MOOC is a part of the Erasmus + Project funded by the European Commission. In this MOOC, you will not only learn what the current legal framework is, but also, how it is applied in the road transport sector.\\n\\nAfter participating in this MOOC, you will be able to: \\n\\n1. Describe the basics of the process of European integration, in the light of the affirmation of the four fundamental freedoms \\nof the EU, European framework on private international law, the posting of workers, social security coordination and social dialogue.\\n2. Understand the interplay between Treaty provisions and secondary sources in the relevant fields.\\n3. Understand the frictions between the rationales underneath the legal provisions that govern EU social policy and labour law.\\n4. Analyse the most relevant case law of the European Court of Justice with an impact on the rights of international road transport workers.\\n5. Familiarise with official documents of the EU institutions and with academic and other relevant literature in this field.\\n6. Use, where relevant, the implementation of EU rules by Member States.\\n7. Solve cases dealing with the implementation of the applicable legal provisions.\\n\\nWe are offering you knowledge clips, memoranda that contain in-depth legal information on the different key topics, recommended readings and case law. Next to that after each module, you could test your acquired knowledge by taking a multiple choice test. In the end of this course, you will be able to apply everything you have learned in a practical manner by solving our sample guide case that resembles a real life scenario which challenges you to deal with everyday's problems faced in the cross-border road transport by practitioners in the field. \\n\\nBy participating in this MOOC, you will find answers to the following questions:\\n\\n1. Which of the four fundamental freedoms is applicable?\\n2. Which court has jurisdiction over a labour dispute and which law governs the cross-border employment relation?\\n3. How to apply and enforce the rules stemming from the Posting of Workers Directive?  \\n4. Which social security system is applicable and which social security institution is competent to levy the social security contributions? \\n5. What is the role of social partners in the cross-border road transport?\\n\\nIn the end it all makes SENSE! So let's go down this road together. Buckle up!\",\n",

Cela est particulièrement vrai des villes africaines, où la croissance s’opère principalement en périphérie, par la création de quartiers précaires où se concentre la pauvreté urbaine.\\n\\nL’existence et l’extension de ce type de quartiers interrogent sur la capacité de ces villes à intégrer les populations pauvres, en même temps qu’elles révèlent les limites des politiques urbaines à planifier et réguler le développement des grandes agglomérations. La question est devenue si préoccupante que la question de la restructuration des quartiers précaires dépasse aujourd’hui le cadre strict d’une intervention physique pour se poser comme une question de développement à part entière.\\n\\nQuelle lecture peut-on faire de l’existence et de la prolifération des quartiers précaires en Afrique? Quelles ont été, jusqu’ici, les approches et réponses apportées par les gouvernants et les bailleurs? Quels modes et quels outils ont été expérimentés pour leur restructuration? Et quelles leçons peut-on tirer de la mise oeuvre des diverses opérations initiées au cours des années passes?',\n",

Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\\n\\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\\n\\nThe course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\\n• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\\n\\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard\\'s Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.\\n\\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:\\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\\n• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies\\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\\n• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\\n• explain the foundations of economic growth\\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals\\n\\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.\\n\\n\\nIn order to receive academic credit for this course you must successfully pass the academic exam on campus. For information on how to register for the academic exam – https://tauonline.tau.ac.il/registration\\n\\nAdditionally, you can apply to certain degrees using the grades you received on the courses.

But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.\\n\\nAfter we’ve covered the basics, we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback.

Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   \\n\\nFurthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. \\n\\nAt the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. \\n\\nThe Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities’ exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle – from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.\\n\\nIn line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives? \\n\\nCourse Objectives:\\nAt the end of this course, learners should be able to:\\n\\n•\\tRecognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities\\n•\\tUnderstand the drivers of urban risk and vulnerability in the context of climate change \\n•\\tDistinguish the typologies, approaches, and tensions of climate change adaptation \\n•\\tExplain the different approaches and steps in climate change planning \\n•\\tExamine the decision support and assessment tools for climate change\\n•\\tDevelop a climate change plan based on participants’ city contexts',\n",

Historically, climate-related hazards such as drought, flooding, pest and disease outbreaks, coastal storms and heat waves have had devastating impacts on people and the environment in which they live. Often the damage knocks back progress that has been made in social and economic development, slowing down the achievement of development goals.  Climate models suggest that many of these climatic hazards will intensify as the global climate warms. Building resilience to climate risks, through adaptation, is critically important for future development in Africa.\\n\\nThe course will examine adaptation in theory and in practice, through a focus on four sectors that are critically important for climate resilient development in Africa: Water Security, Agriculture and Food Security, Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services and Resilient Cities.',\n",

La ganadería proporciona ingresos y alimento a mil millones de personas pobres y para muchos campesinos en condición de pobreza, el ganado es una fuente de energía como fuerza de tiro, un medio de transporte, una fuente esencial de fertilizante orgánico para cultivos agrícolas, provee subproductos como la lana y el cuero, y funge como un mecanismo de ahorro y capital en momentos de necesidad económica, por ejemplo mediante la venta o el intercambio de un animal en caso de ser necesario. \\n\\nEn este contexto, el curso aborda los beneficios y retos de la ganadería y la necesidad de transitar hacia nuevos esquemas de producción más amigable con el ambiente. Asimismo, profundiza en los sistemas agrosilvopastoriles como alternativas productivas sociales y ambientalmente viables, así como rentables que no sólo repercuten en el bienestar a nivel local sino que contribuyen al cumplimiento de metas globales de desarrollo sostenible. A lo largo del curso, se presentarán conceptos clave tales como  “ganadería climáticamente inteligente”, “buenas prácticas ganaderas”,“manejo integral del paisaje” y los “servicios ecosistémicos”.',\n",

       " [\"This course is multidisciplinary in nature, and aims to equip the global audience of interested lay people, people with chronic disease, public health researchers, health clinicians, students, administrators, and researchers to reflect on the overall impact of the burden of chronic disease . It shows how all chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer) are related by a set of common causes, and that such diseases should be tackled, not individually, but as part of a complex system, with interrelated contributing factors. These factors are genetic, environmental, psychological, economic, social, developmental, and media related. \\n\\nThe Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney is a unique interdisciplinary education and research hub which seeks solutions to chronic disease through a complex systems approach. Academics in many disciplines (in Science and Medicine, but also in Architecture, Humanities, Law etc)  work in a collaborative fashion to produce novel solutions to the problems of chronic disease.  All contributors and participants in this course are members of the Charles Perkins Centre and will  speak from the unique interdisciplinary perspective that this Centre affords. \\n\\nThe course will describe a complex systems approach as the most productive way to ease the burden of chronic disease. It then describes  these diseases in detail, their risk factors, and the environmental and biological factors that have led to the  current epidemic of  obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the solutions – and more importantly the process for finding solutions- is the subject of the last module. No one approach by itself can ever be the answer, and certainly not a simple diet and exercise approach. \\n\\nThe entire course consists of 5 content modules, plus an extra module for completing assignments and discussions, and takes about 6 weeks to complete. Completion certificates are issued on the basis of participation in all 6 modules. \\n\\nWhat you'll learn: \\n-\\tHow the Charles Perkins Centre recruits interdisciplinary teams to ease the burden of chronic disease\\n-\\tHow a complex systems approach is necessary to provide solutions to a complex problem\\n-\\tThe fundamentals of chronic disease research and where it is heading\\n-\\tThe biggest risk factors for chronic disease and their global incidence\\n-\\tThe biological, genetic, social, regulatory, and other influences that have inflated these risk factors\\n-\\tHow to provide solutions globally for the reduction of chronic disease\",\n",

Engineers are supposed not only to carry out their work competently and skilfully, but also to be aware of the broader ethical and social implications of engineering and to be able to reflect on these.  According to the Engineering Criteria 2000 of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the US, engineers must have “an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility” and should \"understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context.” \\n\\nThis course provides an introduction to ethics in engineering and technology. It helps engineers and students in engineering to acquire the competences mentioned in the ABET criteria or comparable criteria formulated in other countries. More specifically, this course helps engineers to acquire the following moral competencies:\\n\\n- Moral sensibility: the ability to recognize social and ethical issues in engineering;\\n- Moral analysis skills: the ability to analyse moral problems in terms of facts, values, stakeholders and their interests;\\n- Moral creativity: the ability to think out different options for action in the light of (conflicting) moral values and the relevant facts;\\n- Moral judgement skills: the ability to give a moral judgement on the basis of different ethical theories or frameworks including professional ethics and common sense morality;\\n- Moral decision-making skills: the ability to reflect on different ethical theories and frameworks and to make a decision based on that reflection.\\n\\nWith respect to these competencies, our focus is on the concrete moral problems that engineers encounter in their professional practice. With the help of concrete cases is shown how the decision to develop a technology, as well as the process of design and production, is inherently moral. The attention of the learners is drawn towards the specific moral choices that engineers face. In relation to these concrete choices learners will encounter different reasons for and against certain actions, and they will discover that these reasons can be discussed. In this way, learners become aware of the moral dimensions of technology and acquire the argumentative capacities that are needed in moral debates with stakeholders (e.g. governments, users, and commercial business departments).',\n",

Les thèmes abordés se dérouleront selon une séquence hebdomadaire décrite ci-dessous (section « plan du cours »).\\n\\nLe virus Ebola qui a été à l’origine de l’épidémie en Afrique de l’Ouest est une souche Zaïre, considérée comme la plus dangereuse. Cependant le spectre des tableaux cliniques rencontrés s’est montré très large : depuis des formes assez bénignes (pour environ 30% des infections), jusqu’à des formes très sévères, presque hors de toute ressources thérapeutiques et fréquemment mortelles en une dizaine de jours en moyenne (environ 30%), en passant par des formes d’une gravité dépendant de l’infrastructure sanitaire responsable de leur prise en charge (c’est-à-dire généralement de bon pronostic en cas de bonne prise en charge diagnostique et thérapeutique). Près de 60% des contaminations en Afrique avaient comme origine les rites funéraires non sécurisés. Les personnels de santé exposés ont également payé un très lourd tribut à l’épidémie. Enfin les conséquences non sanitaires, d’ordre social, politique et économique de l’épidémie ont été considérables, tant localement, que régionalement ou internationalement. Peu de pays ont connu à ce jour d’importants développements de chaînes de contaminations, en dehors de la Guinée, du Libéria et du Sierra Leone, mais la situation au Mali à la fin novembre 2014 était encore source d’incertitude et d’inquiétude. Les modèles mathématiques, s’ils ont été d’un apport précieux dans l’éclairage des politiques publiques, ils ont aussi participé à une amplification exagérée du problème, notamment lorsqu’ils ont livré des prévisions allant au-delà de plusieurs mois, parfois endossées par de grandes agences sanitaires, car elles risquent de se révéler fausses et décrédibilisantes.\\n\\nNous tenterons de mieux savoir quels espoirs on peut avoir de disposer d’un vaccin prochainement, et nous essaierons de comprendre pourquoi il aura fallu attendre 38 ans, depuis la découverte du virus Ebola, pour que la communauté internationale se décide à chercher et développer un vaccin contre ce type de virus que l’on savait hautement pathogène et contagieux. La réponse internationale a-t-elle été à la hauteur des enjeux ? L’OMS a-t-elle pu mettre en œuvre le Règlement Sanitaire International dans des conditions satisfaisantes ? Quelle a été la place des ONG dans le règlement du problème ? Toutes ces questions feront l’objet, au cours de ce MOOC, de débats et de points de vue interdisciplinaires, parfois contradictoires. De même, l’importance de la communication, le rôle des médias, la perception du risque par la population et par les décideurs eux-mêmes seront analysés. Une large plage sera réservée aux réponses aux questions des participants adressées aux orateurs par le forum de discussion, afin de réfléchir comment vaincre ensemble Ebola.\\n\\nPUBLIC CIBLE\\nCe MOOC est ouvert et gratuit pour tous les publics.

       " ['Charles Darwin, en su libro titulado “El Origen de las Especies” (Darwin, 1859) presentó evidencias relativas a dos aspectos importantes: la teoría de la evolución y los mecanismos de la evolución, conocido como selección natural. Sus investigaciones llegaron a la conclusión de que debido a que todo individuo es diferente a sus semejantes, algunos de ellos inevitablemente se adaptarán mejor y sobrevivirán bajo las condiciones del medio ambiente que los rodee que otros de ellos. En cada generación, una proporción de la población morirá antes de alcanzar la madurez, los individuos que mejor se adapten a su medio ambiente sobrevivirán, mientras que los menos aptos morirán. Más aún, si las características de adaptación son hereditarias, los sobrevivientes, quienes serán los progenitores en la siguiente generación, tenderán a transmitir sus características a sus descendientes. Por lo tanto, la generación siguiente presentará una mayor proporción de individuos mejor adaptados a su medio ambiente en comparación con la generación previa. Por tal motivo, el proceso de selección natural cambiará las características promedio de una especie, presentándose de este modo el proceso de evolución. La Computación Evolutiva (Evolutionary Computation, EC), aplica la teoría de la evolución natural y la genética en la adaptación evolutiva de estructuras computacionales, proporcionando un medio alternativo para atacar problemas complejos en diversas áreas como son ingeniería, economía, química, medicina y porque no, las artes, por mencionar algunos campos de aplicación. Una población de posibles soluciones de un problema dado es análoga a una población de organismos vivos que evolucionan cada generación al recombinar los mejores individuos de la población y transmitir sus características de dichos individuos padres, a sus descendientes. En este campo, diferentes esquemas de métodos evolutivos se han desarrollado, los cuales difieren en el tipo de estructuras que conforman la población. Algoritmos Evolutivos (AE), como también se le conoce al Cómputo Evolutivo (EC), se definen como métodos de optimización y búsqueda, los cuales están inspirados y tratan de imitar de manera parcial los procesos de la evolución natural, los cuales mantienen una población de estructuras que evolucionan de acuerdo a reglas de selección y otros operadores genéticos como son cruzamiento y mutación (Bäck, 1996).\\n\\nLos algoritmos evolutivos no son los únicos métodos de optimización propuestos a partir de sistemas biológicos. Se tienen una variedad de algoritmos de optimización que tratan de imitar el comportamiento de sistemas naturales como son las colonias de hormigas, algoritmos culturales y optimización por cúmulos de partículas entre otros. De aquí surge lo que se conoce como algoritmos bio-inspirados, ya que toman sus bases a partir de la estructura de procesos y sistemas biológicos: la evolución, la selección natural, comportamiento social de animales como son las hormigas, abejas, peces.\\n\\nBÄCK, T.

Another important task of this course is to provide the deep understanding of the difference between cultural and symbolic meaning products (such as films, recorded music, book and periodicals, online media content etc) and other kind of goods. \\n\\nThis course will help you to: \\n  - Identify main peculiarities of cultural and symbolic goods in their difference with other branches of economy in terms of production chain, risks, relationship between different stages of production. \\n  - Be able to analyze cultural products and symbolic goods from the organizational, economic, business model point of view.\\n  - Be able to invent new business models and analyze cultural products in terms of their productions risk.  \\n  - Be able to analyze cultural policies and creative industries/clusters policies.\\n\\nMain prerequisite to this course is to be able to produce analytical texts in humanities. Normally the course addresses all students of master level interested in peculiarities of media and cultural economy and management. This course is strongly not recommended for those who:\\n  - Analyse any market or industry only in microeconomic terms (supply and demand, level of competitions etc). This course is not about market but about peculiarities of symbolic goods;\\n  - Try to interpret culture only in terms of marketing and management (i.e. culture is considered like a simple good to be sold to the consumer). This course considers it more broadly like a human agency to produce meanings of everyday life. That’s why cultural goods are different and can not be interpreted exclusively in terms of consuming and need more or less state support;\\n  - Try to interpret culture like pure “art” and consequently are absolutely not preoccupied by organizational aspect of its working.  \\n\\nThis course uses a large number of concepts coming from different fields of science: political economy of communications, cultural studies, sociology etc. Some aspects of the course are commented by known scholars in this field such as David Hesmondhalgh (University of Leeds), Phillipe Bouquillion (University Paris 13 Nord), Bernard Miege (Grenoble Alpes University).',\n",

       " ['Relativism is an ancient philosophical doctrine which has recurred time and again in the history of philosophy. It has also transcended the boundaries of that discipline, for it has shaped much of the methodology in anthropology and sociology, as well as in critical theory and literary studies. While often advocated for its supposed tolerance of differences, relativism has profound consequences for how we think of reality, for the possibility of knowledge, both in the factual and in the moral domain, and may engender the practice of double standard. \\n\\nIf a wind is hot for me and cold for you and none of us is at fault, does this mean that reality is always perspectival, or that it admits of contradictory descriptions? If a belief turns out to be justified when evaluated within a certain epistemic system (such as religion, for instance), while it turns out to be unjustified if assessed from within a different one (science, say), does relativism undermine the very possibility of knowledge? If an action can be morally permissible within an ethical system and not so within a different one, does that challenge the idea that there are moral truths and moral progress? These are some of the questions we will engage in during the course, while considering examples taken from the history of science, such as the Bellarmine-Galileo dispute, and from everyday life.\\n\\nThis course is aimed at anyone who is interested in learning more about philosophy, along with those who are looking for strategies to combat extremism in their communities. Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life.\\n\\nIn this course, learners will:\\n\\nExplore the concept of Relativism\\nDiscuss the role of Relativism in contemporary society\\nIdentify common responses to Relativism\\nCompare/Contrast various forms of Relativism \\nRecognize how epistemic relativism can be used to explain important events in the history of science and crucial discoveries in anthropology\\nCreate a presentation with your personal perspective on one of the forms of relativism',\n",
